Interactive Intelligent Kitchen Helper

Problem Statement : 
The Interactive Intelligent Kitchen Helper (IIKH) is a PC-based application that will replace the index-card system of recipes found in the average kitchen. But more than simply maintaining a database of recipes, the kitchen helper assists in the planning of meals for an extended period, say a week. The user of the IIKH can sit down at a terminal, browse the database of recipes, and interactively create a series of menus. The user can also add a new recipe, modify existing recipe, view recipes or delete a recipe.
 The IIKH will automatically  print out menus for the entire week, for a particular day, or for a particular meal. The IIKH can be extended for multiple users.
